CompSci 308 Cell Society Project

Derek Hill, Jimmy Shackford, Jonathan Rub

Start: 1/25

Finished: 2/12

Hours: 240


##Roles:

Derek - Simulation implementation, generic cell structure

Jonathan - Cell grid, individual cell subclass implementation (shapes), Exception handling, Fire Rule

Jimmy - GUI, Segregation Rule, XML

We all additonally helped each other with other parts as needed.


##Sources:

JavaWorld.com - exception research


##Files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main):

Main is used to start project


##Files used to test the project:

XML files are in data folder


##Any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files):

English.properties - language resource file


##Any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs):

Once the program is run, the user can select from a number of different simulations through a drop down menu. The user can also display multiple simulations on the display and adjust certain parameters of the simulation dynamically using sliders. The simulations available are Fire, Game of Life, Wa Tor, SugarScape, Ant Foraging, and Segregation. The user can change the shape of the cell in the XML file.


##Any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality:

Display extends past edge for sugar and edge sims. Width and height sliders do not work, shape combo box does not work.


##Any extra features included in the project:

As discussed above, the program allows the user to display multiple simulations as well as dynamically change various parameters of the simulation. Cells can be changed to hexagons or triangles. 6 simulations are available. Error checking is in place to avoid various errors. A graph is available


##Your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future:

Since this is a class focused on the design of programs we think a better way to help students learn good design would be to not require the implementation of so many features in such a short amount of time. What seems to happen is the team gets overwhelmed with all of the extensions and sloppy code gets introduced as time runs out.
